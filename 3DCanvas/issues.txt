//This is pre-release code. It needs cleanup and structure. Working on it. 

ISSUES:
X 1- Canvas size cannot be calculated on the fly. Percentages will pixelate inner drawings.
X 2- images need preloading. 
X 3- is a background really needed? It's just another element drawn. Doesn't make sense for animation. DONE
4- RequestAnimationFrame
X 5- Multiple canvases on a page drawing.
